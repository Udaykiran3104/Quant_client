# Phase 4: Advanced Email Management - Implementation Summary

## Filtering and Sorting Emails

This document summarizes the implementation of filtering and sorting capabilities for emails in the Quantum Email Client.

### 1. Email Model Updates

- Added `label_ids` field to the `Email` and `EmailPreview` models to store Gmail label IDs
- Created new data structures for filtering and sorting:
  - `EmailFilter`: Holds filter parameters (label, is_read, search, sender, recipient)
  - `SortField`: Enum for available sort fields (Date, Sender, Subject)
  - `SortOrder`: Enum for sort direction (Ascending, Descending)
- Added `Clone` trait to email models to support various operations

### 2. Database Schema and Query Updates

- Enhanced the `get_emails_for_user` function to support filtering and sorting
- Added dynamic SQL query generation based on filter parameters
- Implemented join queries to retrieve email labels
- Added pagination support with LIMIT and OFFSET parameters
- Created new functions for label management:
  - `add_labels_to_email`: Associate labels with emails
  - `remove_label_from_email`: Remove label associations

### 3. Gmail API Integration Updates

- Updated Gmail API queries to support filtering
- Implemented translation from app filter parameters to Gmail query syntax
- Enhanced email retrieval to include label information
- Added support for Gmail's advanced search operators

### 4. API Endpoint Enhancements

- Updated the `/api/emails` endpoint to accept filter parameters
- Implemented multi-stage filtering:
  1. First try to use Gmail's native filtering
  2. Apply client-side filtering for cached results
  3. Use database-level filtering as fallback
- Enhanced response format to return a unified list of emails
- Created a helper function `apply_filters_to_emails` for client-side filtering

### 5. Performance Optimizations

- Smart cache usage: Skip cache for filtered queries when necessary
- Background refresh of cache to ensure fresh data
- Limit results to reasonable amounts (20-50 emails) for better performance
- Optimized sorting operations to happen after filtering
- Implemented efficient pagination to avoid loading unnecessary data

### 6. User Experience Improvements

- Combined sent and received emails into a single list for easier filtering
- Added source information in responses to indicate data origin
- Added support for Gmail's powerful search syntax
- Implemented consistent error handling across all filter operations

### 7. Documentation

- Created API documentation for the new filtering capabilities
- Added examples for common filtering and sorting operations
- Documented Gmail search syntax for advanced users

### Future Enhancements

- Support for more complex filter combinations
- Advanced label management (creating, editing, deleting labels)
- Filter presets and saved searches
- Server-side search optimizations
- Full-text search capabilities for email content

This implementation establishes a solid foundation for email management, giving users powerful tools to organize and find their emails efficiently.
